the most obvious next step would be to let users enter criteria such as:
	'normal encounter, dark catch' and then list a few dozen different ingredient combinations to
	achieve the desired sandwich.  I could do this soon, or who knows, someone else could use the data
	from this tool and do it before me
	
x add a text-based loading system, so other users can give each other text strings and load up their custom recipes

x handle loading a multiplayer recipe when in single player mode

x remove alias system and just update jsons to have the preferred aliases

add option for labels on ingredients (off by default)

add a tutorial guide/video link at bottom

probably disable being able to modify pieces in simple mode, since it seems to be causing users confusion

fine-tune 2-star type and level calculation (to pass all tests)

fine-tune dual-split type and level calculation (to pass all tests)

x narrow down what determines if 2 star, since it looks like dropping >= half total pieces is not exactly it
	might be related to amount of pieces on dish (top of table)

x add a visual identifier for how many players it takes to make a multiplayer recipe, minimum

make search panel take search criteria in current language instead of just english

update italian preset sandwich recipe names (can't find them online)
